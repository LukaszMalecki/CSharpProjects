The folder contains some of the scripts and screenshots of the game I made for a GameJam.
The GameJam lasted 2 weeks and I was making the game by myself so it takes about 5-10 minutes to beat.
It also means that I had to use some shortcuts in the code, such as using goblin enemy controller for the final enemy.

Features:
-platforming challanges
-health power ups
-boss fight
-double jump power up at the end of level 1
Cons:
-no sounds
-simple enemies
-very short



Controls:
	- Right and Left arrow keys - horizontal movement
	- spacebar - jump
	- x - attack

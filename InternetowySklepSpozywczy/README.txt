This project was made by me and my friend, but the code part implementation, besides setting up the project and database, is my own.
The project was never really merged together so my code and my friend's code ended up on separate branches (mostly because I wasn't really experienced with github at the time).
For the project we made many diagrams and such in Visual Paradigm with UML.
